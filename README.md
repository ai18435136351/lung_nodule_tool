# lung_nodule_tool
A simple lung nodule contour generation tool.


If you want to show the tool's page, run：
  
  lung_nodule_tool.py.
  
In the tool interface，you can load mhd files or mha files from menu files, click button '图片显示' to show the picture
  outline_gen.py is the main code to generate the image outline

The code is a bit rough and there are some bugs in it. This is my first time to learn how to make tools. If there are weak points, please excuse me
